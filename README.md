When you join Flatiron School, you join a community. You’ll have the opportunity to work with others and join a rich group of alumni and other data scientists. Below are some details about different ways to access and get involved in our community.

## Your Support Team 
**Cohort Lead** - your instructor, who you will meet with for technical support. Cohort Leads provide support and mentorship throughout the entire program through 1:1 sessions up to once per week as well as occasional live lectures. They’ll also be a presence in Slack, helping the cohort communicate and work together.

**Educational Coaches**  - are your go-to, non-technical support. Flatiron School offers the opportunity to partner with an Educational Coach to check-in and help you stay accountable to your goals, anchor to your motivation in learning a new skill, and make steady forward progress at a pace that is right for you. Educational Coaches act as community leads for the cohort and partner with students to offer occasional 1:1 check-ins from the start of the program until they become eligible for Career Coaching towards the end of the program. 

**Career Coaches** - are waiting for you toward the end of your educational journey to provide individualized support for all things job related. You can learn more about the type of support Career Coaches provide in the “Meet Career Services” lesson.

## Community Slack Channels 
Slack is the primary mode of communication for our Learn community, and your cohort Slack channel is your homeroom. Important information is posted regularly, so plan to check in daily.

Since students are members of a virtual classroom, our expectation is that each student adds a profile photo of themself and uses their name as Slack username so their classmates will know how to greet them.

You are invited to join affinity groups and other community-oriented Slack channels. Slack also serves as a tool to raise technical questions, and meet fellow classmates who are at a similar point in the program. Ask your Educational Coach or fellow students about specific Slack channels to join based on your geographic location, interests, and current progress in the curriculum.

## Flatiron Campuses
Online students who live in a city with a Flatiron School campus are welcome (and encouraged!) to attend community events on campus, or to drop by and work independently in the space. Check-in with the Campus Staff and let them know you’re a Flatiron School online student! If you’re curious whether there’s a campus in your city or where it is, check out www.flatironschool.com, or e-mail info@flatironschool.com.
